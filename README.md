# KJFlooring
Android Application to quote Flooring Cost

The purpose of this application was to create an app that would function for a small business of varying size and offer a reason for why users would download it.  The "hook" in our application is a calculator that provides users with a quote based on their square footage and our products.  All images are free to use from pixabay
